Summary / Storyboard :

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the Superstore's performance. The story unfolds by first looking at high-level metrics and then drilling down into specific areas of interest.

Profitability is a key concern. While overall sales are strong, profitability varies drastically across product sub-categories. Copiers and Phones are the most significant profit drivers, while Tables are consistently unprofitable and represent a major area for business review.

Sales show seasonal peaks. There is a clear upward trend in sales over the years, and sales consistently peak in the fourth quarter (Q4), especially in November and December, suggesting a strong holiday season impact.

Geographical concentration is another key finding. Sales are not evenly distributed across the country. Key states like California and New York are critical markets, contributing a substantial portion of total revenue.

Finally, the Consumer segment dominates. It is the largest source of sales, followed by the Corporate and Home Office segments, which highlights the importance of retail customers to the business.
